# from a second checkout, submit the FIRST tree's code -- silently, once both

# hundreds of MB, and all of them are gitignored rather than copied per
# checkout. Spelled out rather than taken from ISMIP7_WORK, which
# sites/local.env lets each user point at their own project space: that would
# move the data with it, into a tree holding none. The meshes and MAPs sit
# beside them; a run from a second checkout names ISMIP7_MESH on the submit
# line, as the 2 km inversions do, with ISMIP7_MAP_OUT for an inversion (where
# the MAP is written) or ISMIP7_INVERSION for a forward (which MAP to read).
