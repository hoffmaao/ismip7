r"""handoff.py - keeping one objective across an inversion's restarts.

A chained inversion warm-starts each link from the previous link's periodic
checkpoint. The optimiser only continues the same minimisation if the link
minimises the same objective from the point the previous link had accepted:

* every setting the objective depends on is recorded in the checkpoint and
  compared here on the warm start (:func:`objective_mismatches`); a link
  that would change one refuses under ``ISMIP7_WARM_START_STRICT=1``;
* the checkpoint holds the controls of the last ACCEPTED iterate, not of the
  last evaluated trial point of the line search
  (:func:`accepted_evaluation`);
* the checkpoint records the objective at that iterate, and the next link's
  first evaluation must reproduce it (:func:`handoff_gap`).

Rice (26 Sep 2026): "between restarts I think we need to check to make
sure the optimizer doesn't change."
